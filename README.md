# .Net_Projects

This repository contains all my .NET practice and assignment projects developed using **Visual Studio 2022**. These projects cover multiple .NET technologies like:

- Console Applications
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- Razor Pages (ASP.NET Core Web Apps)
- MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
- Inheritance, Generics, OOP, and more

Each folder represents a different weekly task, project, or learning objective from my Computer Programming course.
